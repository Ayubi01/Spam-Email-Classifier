Spam Email Classifier
The Spam Email Classifier is a Chrome extension designed to detect and classify spam emails. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of emails and determine whether they are spam or legitimate. This tool integrates seamlessly into a user's browser, allowing them to input emails and get real-time results about the spam probability of each message.

Features:
Email Input: Users can manually input email content for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model identifies patterns commonly associated with spam emails, such as suspicious keywords, phishing links, and unusual sender addresses.
Chrome Extension Interface: A user-friendly interface built into the Chrome browser for easy access and interaction.
Real-time Classification: The classifier runs in real time, providing users with instant feedback on whether an email is spam.
Flask Backend: The system communicates with a Flask application on the backend, which processes the email content and classifies it using the machine learning model.
Accurate Detection: The classifier has been trained on a large dataset to ensure a high accuracy rate for detecting spam emails.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: Chrome Extension (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Pre-trained spam classification model
Deployment: Hosted locally or on a cloud server for real-time detection
